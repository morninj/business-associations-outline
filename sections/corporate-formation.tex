\subsection{The Corporate Entity and Limited Liability}

\subsubsection{\emph{Walkovsky v. Carlton}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Carlton organized 10 taxi corporations, each owning two cabs and 
    carrying the minimum allowed liability insurance. The plaintiff argued 
    that they operated as a single enterprise, and that Carlton is personally 
    liable because he structured his business to defraud the 
    public.\footnote{Casebook p. 176.}
    \item Courts can pierce the corporate veil to prevent fraud or achieve 
    equity.
    \item When anyone (either a person or a corporation) uses a corporation 
    for his personal ends, he can be liable under respondeat superior for the 
    corporation's acts.\footnote{Casebook p. 176--77.}
    \item Here, there was no evidence that Carlton was conducting business in 
    his personal capacity. So, Carlton is not personally liable under an 
    agency theory.
    \item Moreover, there was no fraud. It is not fraudulent for a taxi 
    company to take out the minimum required insurance, nor is it illicit to 
    organize its enterprise as many separate corporations.\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 178.}
    \item Judge Keating, dissenting: these corporations were intentionally 
    undercapitalized in order to avoid responsibility. ``What I would merely 
    hold is that a participating shareholder of a corporation vested with a 
    public interest, organized with capital insufficient to meet liabilities 
    which are certain to arise in the ordinary course of the corporation's 
    business, may be held personally responsible for such 
    liabilities.''\footnote{Casebook p. 178--80.}
