\section{Public Company Governance---Proxy Fights}

\subsection{Strategic Use of Proxies}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Shareholders can use proxies to vote on their behalf. Directors, and 
    sometimes insurgents, will try to collect as many proxies as they 
    can.\footnote{Casebook p. 516--17.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Levin v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The ``O'Brien group'' (incumbents) and the ``Levin group'' 
    (insurgents) were battling for control of MGM. Both were soliciting proxies 
    for an upcoming shareholders meeting.\footnote{Casebook p. 518.}
    \item Levin and his group sued the defendants over the methods they used to 
    solicit proxies. Specifically, they complained about the use of MGM funds to 
    pay for special attorneys, PR firms, and proxy solicitation organizations; 
    and the use of MGM's offices, employees, goodwill, and business contacts. 
    They sought an injunction and damages.
    \item Held: there was no ``illegal or unfair means of 
    communication~.~.~.~.''\footnote{Casebook p. 519.} Amounts paid were not 
    excessive.
\end{enumerate}
