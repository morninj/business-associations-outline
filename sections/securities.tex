\subsection{Definition of a Security}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A security is any kind of tradable asset. They generally fall into 
    three categories: debt securities (e.g., bonds), equity securities (e.g., 
    common stock), or derivative contracts (e.g., options).
    \item Under the securities statutes, a security is:\footnote{Casebook p. 
    400-401. See \S\ 2(1) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77b(a): 
    \blockquote{(1) The term `security' means any note, stock, treasury stock, 
    security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of 
    indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing 
    agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or 
    subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust 
    certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided 
    interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, 
    option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or 
    index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value 
    thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a 
    national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, 
    any interest or instrument commonly known as a `security', or any 
    certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim 
    certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe 
    to or purchase, any of the foregoing.}}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Specific instruments---``stock,'' ``notes,'' ``bonds,'' etc.; or
        \item Something that fits within one of the catch-all phrases in \S\ 2, 
        ``unless the context otherwise requires.''
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Why does it matter?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The registration requirements of the Securities Act may apply 
        (but there are exemptions).
        \item ``In general, plaintiffs have a much easier time when they bring 
        suit under the securities laws than than they would if they had to bring 
        suit under state common law fraud rules.''\footnote{Casebook p. 400.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Most litigation turns on whether an instrument falls within one of the 
    \S\ 2 catch-all phrases, especially ``investment contract.'' See 
    \emph{Robinson v. Glynn} below.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Legislation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \S\ 77.
    \item Securities Exchange Act (``Exchange Act'') of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \S\ 78.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Defining ``Security'': \emph{Robinson v. Glynn}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Glynn created GeoPhone in 1995 to commercialize a signal processing 
    technology.\footnote{Casebook p. 402--02.}
    \item In July 1995, Robinson loaned Glynn \$1 million to perform field 
    tests.
    \item ``Letter of Intent'': Glynn pledged to invest \$25 million if the 
    field tests were successful.
    \item ``Agreement to purchase membership interests'': Robinson agrees to 
    invest another \$24 million for a total of \$25 million.
    \item The ``Amended and Restated GeoPhone Operating Agreement'' (ARGOA) 
    detailed contributions, management, and ownership of GeoPhone. Indicated 
    that Robinson's shares were ``shares'' and ``securities'' and exempt from 
    registration under the Securities Act of 1933.\footnote{Casebook p. 402.}
    \item Robinson sued for violation of \S\ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange 
    Act of 1934 and rule 10b-5. He wanted the court to find that his interest 
    was a security.
    \item Robinson's interest was not an exempt ``investment contract'' because 
    Robinson had ``meaningful control.''\footnote{Casebook p. 403--05.}
    \item Robinson's interest was also not a stock:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item No profit-sharing in proportion to the number of shares owned. 
        Robinson received all profits up to a certain level.
        \item Not freely negotiable.
        \item Parties consistently viewed it as a membership interest, not a 
        stock.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Held: Robinson's interest was \emph{not} a 
    security.\footnote{Casebook p. 401, 06.}
    \item The court declined to hold broadly on whether interests in LLCs are 
    investment contracts or non-securities.
\end{enumerate}
