\subsection{\emph{In re Trados Inc. Shareholder Litigation}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Trados negotiated a sale (as a merger) to SDL for \$60 million. 
    Management received \$7.8 million as part of an incentive plan. The rest was 
    distributed among the preferred stockholders. The holders of common stock 
    received 
    nothing.\footnote{\url{https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2013/09/03/delaware-court-of-chancery-upholds-trados-transaction-as-entirely-fair/}.}
    \item A shareholder sued, claiming that the sale was a breach of the board's 
    fiduciary duties.
    \item The court evaluated the transaction under entire fairness because it 
    found that a majority of the directors were interested or had a conflict of 
    interest.
    \item ``~.~.~.~the court concluded that the deal was entirely fair because 
    the evidence showed that the economic value of the common stock at the time 
    of the transaction was zero---i.e., exactly what the common stockholders had 
    received.''
\end{enumerate}
